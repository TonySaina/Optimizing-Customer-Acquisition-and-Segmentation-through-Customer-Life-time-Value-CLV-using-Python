The Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) Analysis project represent a pivotal initiative aimed at enhancing customer acquisition and retention strategies to achieve these overarching objectives. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a metric that quantifies the total value a customer brings to a business over their entire relationship. It factors in various as-pects such as purchase history, frequency of purchases, and the monetary value of transactions. By understanding CLV, businesses can strategically allocate resources, tailor marketing efforts, and pri-oritize retention strategies to cultivate long-lasting, mutually beneficial relationships with customers. 

Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) Analysis, on the other hand, provides a granular understanding of customer engagement through three key metrics:
•	Recency: The time elapsed since a customer's last purchase. 
•	Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases.
•	Monetary: The monetary value of a customer's transactions. 

RFM analysis allows businesses to segment customers based on these metrics, enabling targeted marketing efforts and personalized strategies to enhance customer engagement and loyalty.
